# Minnesota-Traffic-Volume-Project

In this project, the Minnesota Department Of Transportation wanted to identify trends and patterns in traffic on the highways/interstates. They want to have a dashboard to track incoming traffic data with the following:
* Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by **year, month, week, day**, and **hour**
* Traffic volume in different **weather conditions**
* Traffic volume on different **holidays**

Knowing traffic patterns under these conditions will help their team make important **infrastructure** decisions (adding or changing lanes, entrances, or exits). These decisions will ensure that any construction in the future wonâ€™t cause problems for drivers.


Here is the link to the Tableau workbook: [Minnesota Traffic Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viet.pham4981/viz/traffic_volume_17104519921570/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

Besides, here are the materials in this project:
* The CSV file of the dataset
* Screenshot of the dashboard
* Presentation slides
