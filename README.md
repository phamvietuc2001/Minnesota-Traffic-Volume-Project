# Minnesota-Traffic-Volume-Project

##### In this project, the Minnesota Department Of Transportation wanted to identify trends and patterns in traffic on the highways/interstates. They want to have a dashboard to track incoming traffic data with the following:
* Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by **year, month, week, day**, and **hour**
* Traffic volume in different **weather conditions**
* Traffic volume on different **holidays**

Knowing traffic patterns under these conditions will help their team make important **infrastructure** decisions (adding or changing lanes, entrances, or exits). These decisions will ensure that any construction in the future wonâ€™t cause problems for drivers.

Here is the Tableau workbook: traffic_volume | Tableau Public
